        other relevant details. Landlords should also ensure that the property
        is priced correctly and in line with similar properties in the area.

        (tenants) and will be an added advantage for future and will be awarded
        by getting featured on the "featured listing section" of home page for
        more visibility and building credibility on the platform. Landlords who
        consistently provide excellent service and receive positive feedback
        from tenants will be rewarded with higher ratings, which will increase
        their visibility on the platform and make their listings more attractive
        to potential tenants.

        and reputation on the platform. This badge will be prominently displayed
        on their listings and will help increase trust and confidence in their
        properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Landlords should upload high-quality images of the property to help
        their listing stand out from the crowd. These images should be clear,
        well-lit, and should accurately depict the property and its features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additionally, Landlords must ensure that their properties meet all local
        and national safety and health standards and regulations, and should
        also be responsive to tenant complaints and concerns in a timely and
        professional manner
      </li>
      <li>
        Landlords should be transparent in their communication with tenants and
        should be clear about the terms and conditions of the rental agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Landlords should work with tenants in a professional and respectful
        manner, and should always be willing to listen to and address any
        concerns or issues that they may have.
